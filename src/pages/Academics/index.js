              Tabernacle’s Tiny Tigers is a licensed preschool facility and open
              to children from every background. We are a family-centered
              school, partnering with parents to ensure the success of every
              child. Clear and consistent communication between home and school
              is essential. Our school has been serving families in the
              community for 44 years. We offer a variety of childcare options to
              meet your individual family needs. We have half day and full day
              options available. Daycare is available from 6:45am to 6:00pm.
              Parents and children who attend Tabernacle will tell you that our
              school feels like a family. Many of our teachers and staff are
              former students who return to invest back into the school
              community. Lasting friendships are formed here. We invite you to
              start your experience at Tabernacle by joining the Tiny Tigers and

              literacy. Establishing routines and procedures is an important

              Many Common Core standards have been implemented at Tabernacle
              School. The Common Core calls for an increased emphasis on deeper
              understanding of underlying concepts in both the English Language
              Arts and Mathematics standards. Tabernacle School has long
              challenged students not just to memorize facts, but to go deeper,
              think critically, and demonstrate a higher level of understanding.
              Other Common Core Standards address only minimum requirements and
              may be one or more grade levels below what we recognize as good
              teaching. We do not limit ourselves to national standards but go
              beyond, based on our philosophy of learning and sound educational
              practices. In other words, Tabernacle School’s curriculum exceeds
