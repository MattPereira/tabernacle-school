            In case of a resurgence in Coronavirus cases and potential school
            closure, Tabernacle has implemented a Distance Learning Program
            using Google Classroom. Each student has been assigned to a Google
            classroom. Middle School students engaging in distance learning will
            access their curriculum using Ignitia, a Web-based learning
            environment featuring a media-rich, online curriculum.
