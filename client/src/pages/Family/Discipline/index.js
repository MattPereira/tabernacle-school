              The demerit system is a guide for discipline in the sixth through
              eighth grades at Tabernacle School. The positive side of
              discipline is stressed through our Character Counts program. In
              order to maintain the highest standards of character and academic
              excellence at all times, the administration expects students to
              abide by standards of respectfulness and responsibility. Failure
              to abide by the rules and regulations set forth in the Tabernacle
              Parent/Student Handbook will result in the issuing of demerits or
              other disciplinary actions.

                <Typography variant="p">
                  The goal of our discipline policy is to keep students
                  accountable for their behavior and to promote an environment
                  of cooperation and learning. A student will receive a demerit
                  for any disrespectful, defiant, or irresponsible behavior.
                  Demerits accrue each school year from the start of August
                  until the end of the school year. If a student receives a
                  demerit then the teacher or administrator issuing the demerit
                  will fill out a behavior report in FACTS and the parents will
                  be notified of the infraction and the number of demerits
                  issued.

                <Typography variant="p">
                  Demerits serve as a record of a student’s behavior and a
                  communication tool for parents to aid in the character
                  development of their child. Students will be given various
                  amounts of demerits based on the type and severity of the
                  behavior. Demerits may be given at the discretion of the
                  administration for irregular disciplinary scenarios not
                  covered by the list below. Students can be held responsible
                  for their actions away from campus, and may be asked to
                  withdraw from Tabernacle School at the administration’s
                  request. Demerits may be doubled or otherwise increased for
                  successive violations or when the offense is deliberate and/or
                  defiant.
