Children must be allowed to grow without being compared to others. They must know and feel they are important, loved, and valued no matter what they look like, how they behave, or what they are able to achieve. Acceptance must come with no strings attached just like the acceptance that is found in the love of Christ.`,

In this passive age of comforts and entertainment, children can be severely limited, even robbed, of the time to just dream, to look beyond the “already” and wonder at the “maybe.” Dreams are the stuff from which goals are made, goals that for entire lives and nations.",

We want to equip our children with the confidence to explore their identities and potentials, and cheer them on every step of the way.`,

        text: "A disciplined life does not limit, but liberates the child to reach their potential. Like a river that has overrun its banks, the life without boundaries loses its strength. Without boundaries, children lose their sense of security - knowing that there is someone who will help him or her avoid hazards and maintain control until he or she is mature enough to control is on their own.",

Children need the freedom to be children and of relating to adults who can see life through their eyes, who can grasp and share the amazement of every new discovery, the pride and joy of accomplishment, and the fun of simple pay. We need to give our kids their childhood and enjoy it with them.`,

It is facing problems and working through them by the grace God provides that a child can learn strength. Even young children need a certain amount of the right kind of struggles in their lives to exercise the muscles of independence and grow in Christ.",

They need to hear wisdom from the adults in their lives and from the lessons of history. But the greatest reservoir of wisdom the world has ever known is found in the Bible. To learn its wisdom is to provide them the “light” that will never fail them or lead them astray.`,
