        "description": "I have been at Tabernacle for 25 years. The majority of my classes have been middle school.  I look forward to taking the 8th graders to Washington DC each year to bring history and our government alive for them as well as instill a love of history. I am also a firm believer in encouraging leadership and watching our students grow to be responsible, moral leaders. \n\nGod has recently led me to work with the Preschool students.  I look forward to working with the teachers “to start children off on the way they should go” as Proverbs 22:6 says. \n\nI am a big Disney fan. I enjoy biking, reading, and scrapbooking.  My favorite verse is Philippians 4:8-9.",

        "description": "Hey Tigers! I’m Meg Peacock and I’m so excited to be returning for my second year here at Tabernacle. Born and raised in North Carolina, I moved to California with my family after graduating high school in 2004. I attended Cal State East Bay  where I received my BA in Liberal Studies with a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. After graduating college;  I spent the next few years teaching preschool, kindergarten, first, third, and sixth grade math/science in the public school system.\n\nMy husband Dave and I have been married 13 years this fall. We welcomed our beautiful daughter, Sadie in the fall of 2012, and five short years later our son Sutton made his grand debut. \n\nI love traveling, watching my kids play various sports, skiing, hiking, and being with my family. I’m so happy that I get the chance to be a part of your child’s education. My goal as a teacher is for your child to feel welcomed, loved, and safe to learn and flourish into the best version of themselves. I’m a firm believer that God has a perfect plan for our lives and I’m so blessed that he’s placed me here at Tabernacle. It’s going to be an amazing year!\n",

My first year, I was a substitute teacher for Kindergarten through 8th grade. I am beginning my thirteenth year teaching 3rd grade at Tabernacle. I received my B.A. at SFSU and my Masters in Teaching through CSU Fresno. I feel blessed to teach in a school setting where God and Scripture are the center of all learning. I hope to make this year an enjoyable learning experience for my students while encouraging them to rely on God for all things. My husband and I celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary this year. We have four children, all working full time.  This year I have been blessed with a grandson. My hobbies include cooking, baking, and walking long distances.",

Spending my days seeing children make connections, learn to process information, and have successful moments brings me so much joy! I believe each child has God given gifts and talents that are evident in their personality, learning style, and approach to life. I want to guide my students in love for Jesus and others! God has brought me to Tabernacle multiple times throughout my life, first as a daycare helper in college, then a substitute teacher, Librarian, teacher in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and now 4th grade. I'm so thankful that my three children, who are now in Junior High and High School, have had the privilege of attending here at Tabernacle over the years. When I'm not teaching, I enjoy RVing with my family, going to coffee shops and bookstores, volunteering with my kids at our church, and crafting.",

I have seven children, and five grandchildren.  Each one is unique and a blessing in my life.  During my free-time, I enjoy family camping trips, reading a good book, and of course Starbucks! I feel blessed each day to have an impact on young lives.

We have 4 beautiful children, and 3 amazing grandchildren together and are both overwhelmed with the goodness and grace of our Lord for giving us the opportunity to work in such a blessed school. I can't believe I am a grandparent.  \nMy heart and calling is and has always been to love, guard, teach, and lead the youth to a deeper understanding of who Jesus is, and how to fulfill their own calling to become who God has destined them to be. I take this calling very seriously, and promise to lead with integrity, honor, sacrifice, and due diligence that God expects of me.\n",

        "description": "I was born and raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the age of four, I started playing piano. Thru out my school age years, I enjoyed music through singing, playing piano, and acting in plays. I knew in high school that I wanted to pursue a degree in music. When I chose to go to college, I went to Evangel University in Springfield, Missouri. At this liberal arts school, I studied music education. This is also where I met my husband Vince. I got through five years of college, received a bachelors degree in K-12 music education, and got married in 1996.\n\nSince getting married, I’ve taught in both public and private schools, covering every subject in elementary and teaching music to grades K-12. I took time off to stay home with my kids when they were young. Now, I love being back in the groove of sharing my knowledge and passion for music.\n\nVince and I live in Oakley with our kids Kayla, Angel, Gigi, and Ian. We’ve been through many things in our twenty-five years of marriage, but God has been our foundation from the very start. It’s nearly impossible for me to pick a “favorite” Bible verse because I love the entire Bible. One verse that I love to share is Matthew 6:26, because it keeps me from getting stressed out and reminds me that God is in control. *Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? -NIV Every child at Tabernacle is valuable, and I’m delighted to have the pleasure of teaching them.",

        "description": "I have been at Tabernacle for 25 years. The majority of my classes have been middle school.  I look forward to taking the 8th graders to Washington DC each year to bring history and our government alive for them as well as instill a love of history. I am also a firm believer in encouraging leadership and watching our students grow to be responsible, moral leaders. \n\nGod has recently led me to work with the Preschool students.  I look forward to working with the teachers “to start children off on the way they should go” as Proverbs 22:6 says. \n\nI am a big Disney fan. I enjoy biking, reading, and scrapbooking.  My favorite verse is Philippians 4:8-9.",
